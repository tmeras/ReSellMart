## Running Instructions
### Requirements
- Java 17
- Node.js 18+
- Docker
- Stripe API secret key (for payments) & Stripe CLI
- Free ports:
    -   5173 for the frontend
	-	8080 for the backend
	-	3306 for the MySQL database
    -   1080 for MailDev server

#### Environment Variables 
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = {YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE}

### Steps
1. **Listen for Stripe Events** (for payments processing)
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/api/orders/stripe-webhook
```
Set **application.stripe.webhook-secret** in *backend/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml* to
the provided webhook signing secret

2. **Run Backend**
(from project root)
```bash
cd backend
docker compose up -d mysql-resellmart mail-dev
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

3. **Run Frontend** (from project root)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
4. App now running at http://localhost:5173/auth/login  

Login and pay with the following:

| email         | password    | card |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| john@gmail.com| pass123| 4242 4242 4242 4242 |

**NOTES**:
-  Product images in stripe checkout page will not be visible as webhook endpoint is served over HTTP (not HTTPS) during development
- Emails can be viewed at http://localhost:1080/#/

### Running Tests (from project root)
```bash
cd backend
docker compose up -d mail-dev
./mvnw clean verify
```
